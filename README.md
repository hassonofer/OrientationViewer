# OrientationViewer
Android application that show GPS coordinates, azimuth, pitch, roll and altitude.

I wrote this simple application for outdoor measurements I had to take a while back.

An APK signed with a mock certificate available [here] (https://github.com/hassonofer/OrientationViewer/releases/download/0.1/OrientationViewer.apk).

The application requires API 15 (Android 4.0.3) or newer.

Tested on Galaxy S4 GT-I9500.

The altitude is calculated using the atmospheric pressure sensor of the device (not by location).
